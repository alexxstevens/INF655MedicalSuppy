        <p>We are our own Internet Service Provider. We also provide co-location and web serving
        for other businesses both in and out of the Radiology Community. Our own servers sit on racks in our climate
        controlled network room right here in our head office in the East Portland Oregon Metro Area. All systems are UPS
        power protected, with the UPS systems backed up by auto-starting and transferring generation systems. This allows
        us to be <span class="bold">100% in control</span> of our site and keep it up and running with excellence!<br><br>
        Being our own provider also keeps us from being limited to a certain sized site - or being forced to use web
        authoring programs like Front Page, as so many other sites are hosted in the Radiology industry. If we need
        additional server power or features, we just slide another server into our racks and it's ready to serve.
        <br><br>Furthermore, we are not forced to use a seriously overloaded server at some bulk hosting company that also
        hosts adult and other questionable sites that are then filtered or blocked by a lot of ISP's to protect their
        customers from the objectional content. Without all these problems, our sites remain fast, responsive and
        available to you, our customers, <span class="bold">24/7</span> for all your needs, at any time that is the most
        convenient!<br><br><span class="bold">We can host your website on our servers.</span>We specialize in radiology
        related websites. If you are a radiology
        manufacturer, we can work with you to host your site free of charge in exchange for our being able to market your
        products on our websites. Please contact our <a href="mailto:noc@pnwx.com" title="noc@pnwx.com"
