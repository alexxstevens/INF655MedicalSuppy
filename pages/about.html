Simply put - it's hard to say from day to day, but we run around 900+ pages with over 6800 active stock numbers in our database server.Larger cleaner graphics, more detailed product specifications, those are the hallmarks of pnwx.com. We provide you with more Name Brand product choices with more complete product information. Our data entry staff are working from different parts of the country inputting the most up to date information that the manufacturers provide. When discrepancies are found, they are updated immediately by our data entry personnel. When customers call asking questions and/or requesting information that was not previously available and accessible on the website - we research the answers for that customer and add that information to the website right away! That way you are assured the most complete product information
          available!

          <div class="panel-body">We are our own Internet Service Provider. We also provide co-location and web serving for other businesses both in and out of the Radiology Community. Our own servers sit on racks in our climate controlled network room right here in our head office in the East Portland Oregon Metro Area. All systems are UPS power protected, with the UPS systems backed up by auto-starting and transferring generation systems. This allows us to be 100% in control of our site and keep it up and running with excellence! It also keeps us from being limited to a certain sized site - or being forced to use web
          authoring programs like Front Page, as so many other sites are hosted in the Radiology industry. If we need additional
          server power or features, we just slide another server into our racks and it's ready to serve. Furthermore, we are not
          forced to use a seriously overloaded server at some bulk hosting company that also hosts adult and other questionable
          sites that are then filtered or blocked by a lot of ISP's to protect their customers from the objectional content.
          Without all these problems, our sites remain fast, responsive and available to you, our customers, 24/7 for all your
          needs, at any time that is the most convenient!<br>We can host your website on our servers. We specialize in radiology related websites. If you are a radiology
          manufacturer, we can work with you to host your site free of charge in exchange for our being able to market your
          products on our websites. Please contact our <a href="mailto:noc@pnwx.com" alt="noc@pnwx.com">Network Operations Center</a> for more information.
