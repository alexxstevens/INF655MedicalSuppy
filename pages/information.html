                  <p>Normally, on <span class="bold">large items</span> this will <span class="bold">require</span> you to have a <span class="bold">freight dock</span> or <span class="bold">forklift</span>.</p>
                  <p>We can arrange for inside delivery to
                  customers who do not have a freight dock or forklift. However, it is the <span class="underline">buyers responsibility</span> to discuss any special
                  delivery requirements with your Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc. sales representative at the time of order.</p>
                  
                  It is also the <span class="underline">buyers responsibility</span>  to note any and all damages to the shipping container, i.e. boxes, before signing
                  and accepting your shipment. Otherwise, there may be little if anything we can do to assist in repairing or obtaining a

                <p>Many products such as lead apparel require no special assistance to setup and use them. Other items, such as film processors, do require some assembly, setup and technical know-how to make use of them. <br><br>But in no way do we offer services to help the customer un-crate, assemble or otherwise make use of the products purchased from us. Often times you can find local professionals in your area to assist you in this. <br><br>We suggest consulting your local yellow pages under "X-Ray Service". But this is the <span class="underline">buyers responsibility</span> to acquire and pay for said services. <br><br>Finally, some items, such as x-ray generators, require certain licenses from several different government entities. This also is the <span class="underline">buyers responsibility</span>. Usage of x-ray equipment on live humans without the proper credentials and/or licenses is a <span class="bold underline">serious crime</span> in many countries. <br><br>By purchasing such products, you are representing to us that you have, or intend to acquire before usage, any and all legal requirements to use said products in your jurisdiction and that you are fully qualified to do so. Further, you agree to fully indemnify and hold blameless Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc. against any and all liability arising out of the usage of any products purchased from us at any time.

Also, be aware that some freight carriers charge a brokerage fee on top of the duty and taxes.

                <p>Due to the nature of our products, changes or cancellations to an order can only be accepted the day the order is placed, and may require written notice of such action.

                <br><br>
                Any "authorized" product return is subject to a restocking fee! This amount will range from 20% to as much as 50%, depending on the manufactures policies. In addition, the customer is responsible for all freight charges in both directions. Returned products MUST be in new condition with all shipping cartons/manuals/packaging in place, and be accompanied by a "return authorization" number. If not, additional charges may be assessed, and/or the return may be rejected. In the event we are forced to reject your return, you will be responsible for the freight charges to return the product back to you once again.
                <br><br>
                Many of the items we sell are special order or custom manufactured to your specifications. Examples of this are the lead markers and lead aprons. All such products are <span class="bold">NOT returnable!</span> It is your responsibility to ask before ordering a product from us, if that particular item is a "special order" item, and therefore will not be returnable later on if you wish to do so. No returns, which are "authorized", will be accepted after 30 days from the shipment date of your product.
